##### **Ques**:



For a multiset T consisting of non-negative integers, we define: 



-> sum(T) is the sum of all elements in T. For example, if T={0,1,1,3}, then sum(T)=0+1+1+3=5.



-> mex(T) is the smallest non-negative integer not in T. For example, if T={0,1,1,3}, then mex(T)=2 because 2 is the smallest non-negative integer not present in T.



You are given a multiset S of size n consisting of non-negative integers. At first, your score is 0. You can perform the following operations any number of times in any order (possibly zero):



-> Select a subset S′⊆S (i.e., S′ contains some of the elements currently in S ), add sum(S′) to your score, and then remove S′ from S.



-> Select a subset S′⊆S , add mex(S′) to your score, and then remove S′ from S.



Find the maximum possible score that can be obtained.



###### Input:

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). The description of the test cases follows.



The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).



The second line of each test case contains n integers S1,S2,…,Sn (0 ≤ Si ≤50).



###### Output:

For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum possible score that can be obtained.





##### **Solution**:



for \_ in range(int(input())):

&nbsp;   n = int(input())

&nbsp;   res = 0

&nbsp;   lst = list(map(int, input().split()))

&nbsp;   for i in range(n):

&nbsp;       x = lst\[i]

&nbsp;       if x==0:

&nbsp;           res += 1

&nbsp;       else:

&nbsp;           res+=x

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   print(res)
